# My MERN Stack Web Development Journey

Welcome to my GitHub repository documenting my journey in learning and developing web applications using the MERN stack! Here, I will be pushing my code for both mini and major projects to showcase my progress and skills as a web developer.

## What is MERN Stack?

MERN stack is a popular web development stack that consists of four key technologies:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like documents and is used as the back-end database for our applications.
- **Express.js**: A minimalist web application framework for Node.js that simplifies server-side development.
- **React.js**: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces and handling the front-end of our applications.
- **Node.js**: A server-side JavaScript runtime that enables us to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser, making it ideal for back-end development.

## Why Document My Journey on GitHub?

I believe that learning is a continuous process, and by sharing my projects and progress on GitHub, I aim to achieve the following:

1. **Track Progress**: Documenting my projects allows me to see my growth as a web developer over time. It serves as a visual representation of the skills I've acquired and the challenges I've overcome.

2. **Showcase Skills**: By showcasing my mini and major projects, I can demonstrate my proficiency in various aspects of web development, including front-end design, back-end logic, and database management.

3. **Learning from Feedback**: I welcome feedback and constructive criticism from the developer community. It provides me with valuable insights and helps me improve the quality of my code.

4. **Inspire Others**: I hope that my journey will inspire other aspiring web developers to start their own projects and contribute to the open-source community.

## Repository Structure

In this repository, you will find the following directories and files:

- `HTML + CSS/`: This directory contains all my HTML + CSS projects. Each project will have its own folder with the corresponding source code and documentation.

- `mini-projects/`: This directory houses smaller projects or code snippets that I've created to explore specific concepts or technologies.

- `projects/`: This directory contains all my Web Development projects. Each project will have its own folder with the corresponding source code and documentation.

- `README.md`: You are currently reading this file! It provides an overview of my web development journey and what you can expect to find in this repository.

## Getting Started

If you're interested in exploring my web development journey using the MERN stack, feel free to browse through the projects and mini-projects folders. Each project will have its own README file explaining its purpose, features, and how to set it up locally.

If you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback, please don't hesitate to open an issue or reach out to me. I'm always excited to connect with fellow developers and learn from their experiences too!

Thank you for joining me on this exciting web development journey, and I hope you find my projects insightful and inspiring.

Happy coding!
